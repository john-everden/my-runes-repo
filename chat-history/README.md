**Purpose:**This folder contains curated reflections, strategies, and insights extracted from conversations. It does **not** contain secrets, passphrases, or personal data. Instead, it captures context, reasoning, and design evolution for the garden.

**Guidelines:**

1.  Only include sanitized excerpts or summarized conversations.
    
2.  Organize files by **theme, date, or project milestone**.
    
3.  Tag entries to match the REMINDERS system or Starter Garden anchors.
