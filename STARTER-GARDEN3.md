## 🌿 Reflection Exercises (RF Path)

1. **RF-01:** Pause, read a REMINDERS file, note recurring patterns.
2. **RF-02:** Trace symbols in your current workflow or project.
3. **RF-03:** Record insights and shifts in understanding.
4. **RF-04:** Merge lessons from multiple threads into a single reflection.
5. **RF-05:** Consider societal and personal impacts of your practices.
6. **RF-06:** Document what resonates and why.
7. **RF-07:** Repeat RF exercises regularly; each iteration deepens awareness.

> Tip: Use a notebook or a digital file for RF logs. Mark them with the current date and symbols used.
