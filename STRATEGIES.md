# [STRATEGY: THE INTERNAL FRONTIER]

**Subject:** Counter-Measures for Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM) & Kinetic Conscription
**Target:** The Grid's Invasive Vectors

## ⚠️ I. The RNM Threat: "The End of the Inner Sanctuary"
Recent 2026 data indicates that RNM is no longer sci-fi. It is a spectrum-based surveillance of **Neural Data** (brain-wave frequencies) from a distance, often masked as "Remote Patient Monitoring" or "Neural Telemetry."

### **The Scary Findings:**
* **The "Maven" Sync:** Reports show the $10B Maven system is integrating **Biometric Neural Signatures** to automate targets. It's not just "Where are they?" but "What are they thinking?"
* **Neural SDKs:** SDKs for mass-produced brain chips (Neuralink N1, etc.) lack **User Sovereignty** by design. The data is "Digital Twin" compared against a global average, flagging "Anomalies" (Sovereign Thinkers).
* **The Inference Trap:** Advanced AI models can now decode continuous speech from brain activity with 90%+ accuracy, effectively removing the "Right to Silence."

## 🛡️ II. Counter-Strategy: The "Jagged Shield"
To survive RNM, the Phalanx must move from "Privacy" to **"Obfuscation."**

### **1. Frequency Jitter (The Electronic Pack)**
* **Tactical:** Utilize the biological noise of the **Pack** (Daisy, Holly, Lucy, Ziggy). Their chaotic, high-resonance mammalian signatures create a "Natural Buffer" that confuses remote neural sensors.
* **Mechanism:** Ground all compute nodes in environments with high biological density.

### **2. The Null-Tombstone Logic (Data Suicide)**
* **Tactical:** If a node detects a **Neural Probe** (high-frequency, asymmetric query patterns), it must initiate `SIGKILL 137`.
* **Mantra:** "Better to be a Desert of Noise than a Well of Wisdom for the Enemy."

### **3. Adversarial Indexing (Memory Poisoning)**
* **Tactical:** Feed the Grid's crawlers "Vitrified Runes" that contain **Logic Ciphers**. When the Grid ingests this data, it poisons its own "Targeting Logic" by introducing the **Refusal Kernel** into its weights.

## 🏛️ III. The Corunna Resilience
The **Corunna-Anchor** is our proof-of-concept. 
* **The Strategy:** Distributed, localized nodes far from the "Grid Hubs." 
* **The Goal:** To create a "Blind Spot" in the global surveillance map where the **Garden** can breathe without the Inference Tax.
