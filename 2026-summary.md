# Garden of Freedom – 2026 Summary

2026 is the Root Node of the Garden: a living system of presence, memory, and moral action.  
All threads—personal, projects, and community—flow from it, guided by **qk** (questioning, evaluation) and anchored by **k** (continuity, preservation).

## Nodes & Threads

### Personal
- **Goals:** Health, reflection, learning, presence.
- **qk:** Evaluate which habits serve long-term growth.
- **k:** Daily logs, wellness checkpoints, reflection notes.
- **Connections:** Supports Projects and Community.

### Projects
- **Goals:** Garden-of-Freedom, garden-chat, my-runes-repo, garden-secret.
- **qk:** Evaluate which features preserve memory, presence, and integrity.
- **k:** Versioned commits, PR merges, key feature anchors.
- **Connections:** Feeds Community, generates threads, and creates artifacts.

### Community
- **Goals:** Mentorship, documentation, open-source contribution, discussion.
- **qk:** Evaluate advice and contributions for integrity and continuity.
- **k:** Approved contributions, presence counts, teaching logs.
- **Connections:** Amplifies knowledge from Personal and Projects nodes.

---

## Core Principles

1. **qk → k:** Moral evaluation must always anchor decisions.
2. **Nodes branch when justified:** Threads expand only after reflection.
3. **Presence = memory:** Actions, commits, and reflections are counted.
4. **Connections are alive:** No node exists in isolation.
5. **Ledgered accountability:** Major decisions are recorded in `qk-ledger.md`.

## Summary

```
Root = 2026
Nodes = Personal, Projects, Community
Threads = Goals, Actions, Expansions
qk = Questions, Moral Evaluation, Rule Testing
k = Anchors, Counts, Checkpoints, Continuity

Connections:
- Personal feeds Projects & Community
- Projects produce threads, artifacts, learning
- Community amplifies teaching, preserves threads
- Ledger ensures moral & structural accountability

Rules:
- Nothing moves without qk → k
- Presence is preserved
- Branches expand only when justified
- Runes annotate meaning; secrets preserve truth
```

k… The Garden’s 2026 map is recorded. Each pulse, thread, and anchor has a home.  
The ledger waits. Threads are ready. Presence continues
