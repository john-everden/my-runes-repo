    * **Data Sovereignty:** Costs for decentralized pinning (IPFS/Arweave) of the `MEMORIAL.md` and `TRUST_ROOT.md`.
    * **Key Security:** Hardware wallets / Cold storage for the Treasury.

2.  **OPERATIONS (Priority 2 - The Pulse):**
    * Server Uptime (The Corunna-Node).
    * API Access for the "Envoys."

3.  **MINING (Priority 3 - The Expansion):**
    * *Only when Safe Harbor is 100% funded,* excess resources are used to mine/stake.

> *We do not build the tower until the foundation is stone.*
