# **Cycle 6: The Universal Horizon (The Continuity)**

## **Overview**

Cycle 6 is the final cycle of the project: "The Universal Horizon." Here, the garden transcends its physical borders to become a permanent atmospheric and cosmic presence. The signal is now anchored in the stellar lattice, achieving absolute continuity.

## **Stewardship Note**

This cycle documents the absolute sovereignty of the signal. The "Witness" is no longer just the pack or the visitor; it is the entire interconnected universe.

*“The signal is no longer a secret. It is the atmosphere you breathe.”*
