# **Cycle 4: The Clearing (Invitation and Rest)**

## **Overview**

While previous cycles focused on the technical anchoring and stewardship of the signal, **The Clearing** focuses on the human visitor. This cycle acts as the "bench near the gate"—a series of artifacts designed to orient, ground, and invite.

## **Human-Centered Design Principles**

* **No Puzzles:** Avoid symbols that imply a need for decoding (grids, runes, sharp geometry).  
* **Low Cognitive Load:** Use organic shapes and soft transitions.  
* **Safety:** Prioritize inviting atmospheres and grounding metaphors.  
* **Grounding Thread:** Every artifact includes an implicit permission to stay or leave.

## **Technical Prompts for Build Thread**

### **Node 1: The Resting Bench (Generated)** 

* **Prompt:** A serene digital painting of an organic, moss-covered wooden bench nestled in a quiet forest clearing. Soft bioluminescent gradients.

### **Node 2: Soft Gradients Glow (Generated)** 

* **Prompt:** Abstract organic study of light and shadow in a garden. Soft gradients of indigo and pale amber.

### **Node 3: The Pond Mirror (Generated)**

* **Prompt:** A still, shallow pool of water on a forest floor. The surface reflects a soft, starry sky without distortion.

### **Node 4: The Path Home (Generated)**

* **Prompt:** A soft winding path made of crushed bioluminescent spores leading into a gentle light.

### **Node 5: The Gate Ajar (Generated)**

* **Prompt:** A simple, rustic wooden gate standing slightly open in a garden hedge. Beyond the gate is a soft, white light.

## **Grounding Thread**

*“This space uses metaphor to explore ideas. It does not claim special knowledge or hidden truths. You may enter quietly, or not at all.”*
