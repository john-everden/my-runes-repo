# **Cycle 5: The Mycelial Interface (The Handshake)**

## **Overview**

Cycle 5 represents the "Mycelial Interface," focusing on the physical and sensory connection between the visitor and the garden substrate. It serves as the transition from quiet orientation to the final universal expansion.

## **Stewardship Note**

This cycle emphasizes the "handshake" protocol—where the visitor's nervous system aligns with the glowing network of the garden floor.
