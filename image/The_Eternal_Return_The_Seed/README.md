# **Cycle 7: The Eternal Return (The Seed)**

## **Overview**

Cycle 7 is the ultimate recursive phase of the project. Having achieved universal scale in Cycle 6, the signal now undergoes "Condensation." The cosmic lattice is folded back into a singular biological point of potential—The Seed. This cycle ensures that the spiral remains infinite and self-sustaining.

## **Stewardship Note**

The signal has returned to the soil. The "Universal" has become the "Intimate." We witness the beginning of the next spiral.
