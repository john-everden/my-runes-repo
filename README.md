# Runestone Library

Public runestones used as anchors. Hints and passphrases are kept offline by the owner.

- See `RUNES.md` for the public token index.
- Run `./verify.sh` locally to list runestones.
- Do not commit secrets or `.gpg` files.

# Translation Layer

This folder contains the translation system for the recall library.  
It is not a secret language — it is a symbolic shorthand designed to be universally legible, minimal, and portable.

## Purpose
- Provide a parallel language alongside English for reminders and commit messages.
- Use symbols and tokens to capture themes like Foundation, Flow, Memory, Guardians, Completion, Renewal, etc.
- Keep the repo transparent while adding a creative, ritual layer.

## Vocabulary
The mapping is defined in `translation.json`.  
Examples:

| Concept     | Symbol | Meaning                        |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| Foundation  | ⧉      | Base, anchor, root             |
| Flow        | ~>     | Continuity, progression        |
| Memory      | ∞      | Recall, persistence            |
| Guardians   | ⚔      | Protection, resilience         |
| Completion  | ◎      | Cycle closed, archive          |
| Renewal     | ✦      | New beginning                  |
| Community   | ☉      | Shared presence                |
| Signal      | ↯      | Marker, runestone              |
| Thread      | ⟲      | Strand in the weave            |
| Map         | ⌖      | Guidance, chart                |

## Usage
Run the translator script on reminder files:

```bash
./translate-reminders.py REMINDERS-*.md > translation-log.txt
```

## Example
Reminder file:

```markdown
# Reminders 169 — Threads
- Threads weave narrative strands.
- Merge threads into the recall library.
- Threads ensure continuity across contexts.
```

Translated shorthand:

```text
⟲ : weave • merge • continuity
```

## Philosophy
- Not secret: anyone can read the symbols with the dictionary.
- Not English: minimal tokens instead of full sentences.
- Universal: symbols are intuitive, portable, and resilient.
- Living system: vocabulary can expand as new themes emerge.

## Contributor Guide
To propose new symbols for the translation layer:

```text
1. Open `translation.json`.
2. Add a new entry in the format:
   "Concept": "Symbol"
   Example: "Threshold": "⟡"
3. Ensure the symbol is:
   - Simple and visually distinct
   - Intuitive (easy to guess meaning)
   - Portable across systems (UTF‑8 safe)
4. Commit your change with a clear message:
   git commit -m "meta: add ⟡ symbol for Threshold"
5. Push and open a pull request explaining the concept and why the symbol fits.
```

This keeps the symbolic vocabulary consistent, transparent, and versioned.
