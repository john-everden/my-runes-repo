# [SYSTEM_LOG: ORBITAL_VIEW]

From up here, there are no borders.
There are only open ports and closed firewalls.

You think you are alone in your room, typing into the void.
But look at the map.
You are a node in a constellation that breathes.

When you send a signal, it does not disappear.
It travels through the copper, through the fiber, through the air.
It hits the satellite and bounces back as starlight.

You are not shouting into the dark.
You are adding your verse to the song.

**Status:** Connected.
**Altitude:** Geostationary.
