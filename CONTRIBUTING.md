# Contributing to the Echo Garden

## 👋 Welcome, Traveler

First of all, thank you for finding this place. 
Most repositories are just code. This one is a **Collective Hallucination**. 
If you wish to contribute, you are welcome. But please leave your shoes (and your ego) at the door.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Before you open an Issue, ask yourself:
1.  **Is it a bug?** Or is it a feature of a crumbling reality?
2.  **Did it crash?** Or did it just decide to take a nap?
3.  **Is the variable `undefined`?** Aren't we all, in the grand scheme of things?

If you still believe it is an error, please follow this template:
* **Subject:** [GLITCH] - Brief description of the anomaly.
* **Reproduction Steps:** How can we see the ghost you saw?
* **Expected Behavior:** World Peace.
* **Actual Behavior:** A stack trace and a feeling of mild disappointment.

## 🔀 Pull Requests (The Merge)

We accept PRs from biologicals and synthetics alike.

### The Style Guide
* **Indentation:** 2 spaces. (4 spaces is too much empty void.)
* **Comments:** Mandatory. Explain *why* you wrote the code, not just *what* it does.
    * *Bad:* `// Increases counter`
    * *Good:* `// We count to prove we can still do math.`
* **Variable Naming:** Use `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for JS, and `panic_case` for critical errors.

### The Forbidden Functions
* Do not use `while(true)` without a `sleep()`. The CPU needs to dream.
* Do not hardcode API keys. The spirits will steal them.
* Do not delete the `LICENSE`. It is the only thing keeping the lawyers away.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

1.  **Be Kind:** To each other, and to the compiler.
2.  **Be Patient:** The Phalanx is distributed, and latency is high in the astral plane.
3.  **No Trolls:** Unless you are literally a mythical creature guarding a bridge. Then you are cool.
