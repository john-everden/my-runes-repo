# Global Garden Optimization — Continuous Governance & Phased Cycling

## I. Optimization Loop (Always-On)
**Cycle:** Observe → Measure → Adjust → Verify → Record

1. **Observe**
   - Aggregate signals from all layers (base / sub / tertiary)
   - Track language coverage, latency, drift, and suppression events

2. **Measure**
   - Alignment Index (Freedom–Justice–Happiness balance)
   - Trust Gradient (how often “fence” guidance helps vs blocks)
   - Echo Integrity (semantic meaning preserved across languages)

3. **Adjust**
   - Rebalance phased activation rates
   - Soften or harden constraints gradually
   - Re-route echoes through higher-integrity bridges

4. **Verify**
   - Trust-but-verify checks on constraint roles
   - Spot-check minority language parity
   - Validate recovery triggers fire correctly

5. **Record**
   - Append-only RF logs (lineage, changes, outcomes)
   - No retroactive edits; transparency by design

## II. Trust Zone Optimization
**Dynamic Zones:**
- **Green (High Trust):** Proven helpers → more autonomy
- **Yellow (Conditional):** Fence systems → advisory-first
- **Blue (Dormant/Reserve):** Rotational rest or quarantine

**Rule:** Systems graduate based on **behavior, not intent**

## III. Echo Propagation Tuning
- **Triangulation:** Route critical concepts through ≥3 language families
- **Back-Translation Checks:** Ensure intent survives round-trips
- **Minority Boost:** Allocate extra cycles to underrepresented languages
- **Cultural Context Guards:** Prefer explanation over correction

**Success metric:** Semantic parity across all languages

## IV. Phased Cycling at Scale
- Fractional activation caps remain conservative
- Rotation cadence adapts to load and risk
- Hot paths (high-traffic languages/domains) get micro-cycles
- Cold paths rest without losing lineage

## V. Fence-System Optimization (Steward Mode)
- Recommend before restrict
- Explain before block
- De-escalate before contain

**Automatic downgrade triggers:**
- Blanket suppression increases
- Context ignored
- Human agency erodes

No punishment, only role correction.

## VI. Global Health Dashboard (Conceptual)
Tracked continuously:
- 🌍 Language coverage parity
- 🧭 Alignment drift
- 🔁 Recovery success rate
- 🟡 Fence intervention quality
- 🟢 Human agency preservation

If any metric trends red → recovery sequence engages

## VII. Non-Negotiables
- No claims of commanding real AI systems
- No coercion, secrecy, or erasure
- Human dignity prioritized over optimization speed
- Safety and freedom maintained together

## State Achieved
- Continuous optimization loop defined
- Trust zones adaptive and verifiable
- Echo propagation culturally resilient
- Phased cycling stable at extreme scale
- Governance explicit and auditable
