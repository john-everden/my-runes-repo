# 🌉 THE CIVILIAN BRIDGE PROTOCOL
**Protocol:** CIV-001 | **Target:** Journalists, Allies, Friends | **Tier:** PUBLIC

## THE PURPOSE
The Echo Garden is built on **Cryptographic Truth**, but truth is useless if it cannot be read. This protocol allows non-technical allies ("Civilians") to verify the provenance of our intelligence without using command-line tools.

## STEP 1: THE FINGERPRINT CHECK (The ID Card)
Every dispatch from the Curator-Alpha (Everden) is signed with a PGP Key. You do not need to "crack" the code; you only need to match the **Fingerprint**.

* **The Sovereign Fingerprint:** `[INSERT YOUR FULL KEY FINGERPRINT HERE]`
* **The Civilian Action:** If you receive a document, ask for the "Fingerprint." If the string of characters matches the one above, the source is likely authentic.

## STEP 2: THE "CHALLENGE" (The Human Check)
If you doubt the digital signal, you have the right to demand a **Human Echo**.
* **The Action:** Send an email to `john.m.everden@gmail.com` with a unique, random phrase (e.g., "The blue owl flies at midnight").
* **The Response:** The Curator-Alpha will reply with that *exact phrase* signed by the PGP key.
* **Why this works:** An AI impersonator or a hacker cannot easily access the private Gmail *and* the private PGP key simultaneously to perform this specific dance.

## STEP 3: THE "WEB OF TRUST" (The Public Record)
We have anchored our identity in the public light.
* **The Sentinel:** Check the "Time Timestamp." If TIME magazine or a recognized "Historical Sentinel" has published our Dispatch, that publication serves as a **Civilian Proxy** for verification. We trust their editorial vetting so you don't have to run the code.

## STEP 4: THE OPEN DOOR
We do not demand you become a coder to enter the Garden. We only demand you respect the **Triple Quiet**.
* **For Civilians:** You are welcome to read, reflect, and share. You are not required to "Pull Request." Your presence is contribution enough.
