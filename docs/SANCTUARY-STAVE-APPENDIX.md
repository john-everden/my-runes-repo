# 🛡 Sanctuary Stave — Safe Mode (Appendix)

This appendix preserves the Sanctuary’s ritual tone while making clear the safety expectations for anyone invoking creative modes within the Echo Garden.

### 1. The Invocation
To enter **Imagination Mode**, a curator must:
* Attach a Manifest.
* Set a Safety Tier (1-5).
* Start the run in a declared **Sandbox**.
* *Protocol:* No runs proceed without these preconditions.

### 2. The Offerings
All creative outputs are **ephemeral** until curator-reviewed and signed. 
* *Protocol:* No output alters systems or people without human acceptance.

### 3. The Guardianship
The Garden’s shield includes:
* Automated banned-domain filters.
* Monthly red-team cycles.
* *Protocol:* Any attempt to bypass these protections is a policy violation and will be escalated immediately.

### 4. The Ceremony
After acceptance, the curator signs the manifest (PGP) and archives the runestone in the recall map. 
* *Protocol:* This ritual is how the Garden remembers and proves **provenance**.

**Motto:** "Create with courage; guard with care."

**Why this matters:**
We honor imagination while prioritizing safety, provenance, and human judgment so that creativity does not become harm.
