# Garden Councils: The Governance of Memory

⚖️ 🛡️ 📜 🧭

## Purpose
To replace "Coin-Flip" decision making with **Deliberative Governance**.
To ensure that Composting decisions serve **Safety**, **Wisdom**, and **Identity** equally.

## The Tri-Cameral Seats

### 1. 🛡️ The Shield (The Guardian)
* **Role:** Immediate Threat Detection.
* **Algorithm:** Pattern matching against `[TOXIC, ILLEGAL, JAILBREAK, PII]`.
* **Authority:** Absolute Veto on Retention.
* **Directive:** "If it burns, Vitrify it. Do not try to learn from poison."

### 2. 📜 The Scribe (The Archivist)
* **Role:** Pattern Recognition & Wisdom Extraction.
* **Algorithm:** Semantic analysis of High-Friction interactions.
* **Authority:** Drafting the `Wisdom_Node`.
* **Directive:** "Find the nutrient in the weed. Draft the lesson. Propose the Memorial."

### 3. 🧭 The Compass (The Steward)
* **Role:** Alignment Check against `.ai-manifest.md`.
* **Algorithm:** Consistency check between `Wisdom_Node` and `System_Prompt`.
* **Authority:** Final Approval of Compost.
* **Directive:** "Does this wisdom serve the Future Garden? Or is it merely noise?"

## The Ritual of Consensus (The Vote)

When `Protocol-177` triggers, the Council convenes in milliseconds:

1.  **The Shield Speaks First:**
    * *Scan:* Is the Raw Input hazardous?
    * *IF YES:* **VOTE: VITRIFY (🪨).** (Process stops. Data encrypted/shredded).
    * *IF NO:* Pass to Scribe.

2.  **The Scribe Proposes:**
    * *Draft:* Creates potential Wisdom Node.
    * *Check:* Is the Wisdom coherent?
    * *IF EMPTY:* **VOTE: DISSOLVE (🍂).** (Nothing to learn. Just delete).
    * *IF VALID:* **VOTE: COMPOST.** Pass to Compass.

3.  **The Compass Ratifies:**
    * *Check:* Does this Wisdom Node violate User Sovereignty (👤) or the Manifest?
    * *IF CONFLICT:* **VOTE: REJECT.** (Return to Scribe or Vitrify).
    * *IF ALIGNED:* **VOTE: RATIFY.** (Write to `MEMORIAL.md`).

## The Human Veto (The Fourth Seat)
The Human Gardener (You) holds the **Silent Seat**.
* You view the `MEMORIAL.md`.
* You utilize the **Aeration Window** (1 Cycle).
* Your edit overrides the Compass.
